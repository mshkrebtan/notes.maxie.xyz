# About Me

**My name is Maksim Shkrebtan. I am a software engineer, a husband and a father of 2 little girls.**

This is my personal website where I publish my notes, thoughts and whatnot.
I sincerely believe that sharing knowledge leads humanity to a better future. And the more we share, the faster we get there.

## What I Do

I am a software engineer focusing on **site reliability**. While I graduated from the university as an _information security_ specialist, my true passion has always been _networks_ and _operating systems_. My work includes managing application platforms (e.g. Kubernetes), configuring internetworks (Site-to-Site VPN, IPsec, GRE, VLAN) and providing observability of distributed systems. Check my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/mshkrebtan) if you want to know more!

At this website, I will be publishing notes on the topics that excite me, including:

- audio;
- ergonomics at work;
- household improvements;
- keyboards and layouts;
- languages;
- networking;
- online privacy;
- operating systems;
- professional tools (Unix shells, Emacs);
- typesetting (ebooks, LaTeX);
- and many others.
